## CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL

Cloud computing is simply the delivery of computing resources and services like storage, networking, server, databases, artificial intelligence tools, business analytic tools etc via the internet.
The cloud offers three major types of service delivery models.

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

### Infrastructure as a Service IaaS

Every computing task is processed either by a server or a computer located locally or remotely. The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model offers computer infrastructure provided by a third party that can support various operations. Computing resources like servers, storage, networking are provided to the user in a virtualized environment. In IaaS one rent IT infrastructure instead of setting it up physically on-premise, hiring these services provides the flexibility to choose processing capacity (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage space (SSD or HDD) in a scalable way and Iaas uses a flexible payment structure, in which one can pay for services as needed, hourly, weekly, monthly or yearly basis (pay-as-you-go). Some providers also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use.
With IaaS the provider takes care of virtualization software, security, networking and servers needed for the development, deployment and running of applications and services. In general, IaaS lets you bypass the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and data centres.
IaaS provides the lowest form of control of resources in the cloud among the various service model. It enables end-users to scale up and scale down resources base on their needs, reducing the high up-front capital expenditures needed to set up “owned” infrastructure, especially with spiky workloads.

There are several use cases when using IaaS over the on-premise setup offers a lot of benefits, some of these cases include:
- **Big data analytics** - Analysing a large amount of data require a large server and storage. It's easier to provision these resources on the fly in the cloud rather than purchasing a new server each time the workload increases.
- **Disaster recovery** - Instead of continuously buying storage devices and shipping them to an off-site location to backup organization data, it is faster and more convenient to create cloud storage and continuously sync data to it, which ensure all data can easily be recovered in the event of a disaster.
- **Hosting web server** - IaaS can be used to host web servers and scale base on user demand, instead of using limited technical resources setting up servers that become redundant when user request drops.
- **Small-Medium Businesses** - Instead of spending limited capital resources on setting up IT infrastructure, it is much easier to rent just the right amount of compute power needed and scale as the business grows.

All the major cloud providers have services that provide IaaS offerings, some examples of these include:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2), Elastic Block Storage (EBS) etc
- Azure - Virtual Machines (VM), Blob storage etc
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Compute Engine, 
- IBM Cloud - Virtual Server
- Oracle Cloud - Cloud Compute 
- Alibaba - Elastic Compute Service


### Platform as a Service Paas

PaaS model offers an out of the box development and deployment environment and platform that allow developers and hobbyist to design and build applications and solutions over the internet. 
This type of service is ideal for developers who just want to focus on the design, implementation and management of their applications. Without having to worry about the various hardware and software resources needed to successfully run such an application, they can improve their efficiency and focus only on the work that interests them.
The PaaS provider hosts everything needed to run the application, servers, networks, storage, operating system software, databases, development tools at their data centre. Just like IaaS, it offers a flexible payment scheme for its customers, as they can pay a fixed fee to provide a specified amount of resources for a specified number of users, or they can choose 'pay-as-you-go' pricing to pay only for the resources they use. Either method offers the PaaS customers the ability to provision resources to build, test, deploy and update their applications. For a growing business, the application can easily be scaled out in peak hours to meet users requests and scaled in when usage is down, more quickly and inexpensively than if they had to build out and manage their on-premises platform. 
Unlike IaaS the developer has control over only the deployed applications and the configuration settings for the hosting environment. 

There are scenarios where using PaaS offers ideal, some of which include:
- **API development** - Because of its built-in frameworks, PaaS makes it much simpler for teams to develop, run, manage and secure APIs (application programming interfaces) for sharing data and functionality between applications.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** - Out of the box, PaaS can support a range of programming languages (Java, Python, Swift, etc.), tools and application environments used for IoT application development and real-time processing of data generated by IoT devices.
- **Agile development** - PaaS can provide fully-configured environments for automating the software application lifecycle including integration and delivery.

There are quite a number of PaaS offerings in the market including those from leading cloud service providers, some of these offerings include:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Elastic Beanstalk
- Azure - AppServices
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - Compute App Engine
- IBM - Cloud Paks, Red-Hat OpenShift
- Heroku


### Software as a Service SaaS

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a service delivery model where an application/software is hosted in the cloud and it's ready to use over the internet. Instead of installing software together with the necessary libraries required for it to be functional and spending time managing and debugging errors, the cloud-hosted application software is just a few clicks away, freeing us from complex time-consuming hardware and software maintenance. As the IaaS and PaaS, SaaS also offers flexible plans for its users, including monthly, annual fees or even free offerings to access the application directly from the browser, desktop client or mobile app. The application and all the required infrastructure needed to deliver it including the servers, storage, networking, middleware, application software and database are hosted and managed by the SaaS provider and the provider also manages upgrades and security patches.
With SaaS, a private individual or company employee can have access to run applications from anywhere without having to install those applications on a local computer, which can help the organization keep track of their employees productivity.

SaaS helps to provide improved productivity and some popular use cases for it include:
- **Word Processing and Presentations** - These services try to emulate word processing software, spreadsheets, or presentations and are also generating a great deal of business.
- **Business Analytics Tools** - Business tools are constantly changing to keep up with the market, so instead of going through the stress of constantly downloading and updating software, businesses can purchase a plan knowing that they will always make use of up-to-date versions.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** - Instead of setting up CRM software on-premise, the business can use cloud offering which enables employees the opportunity to work from anywhere.
- **Work Collabration** Instead of doing a lot of office networking for employee to work and share files, this can be done using software above the browser, desktop client or even mobile, which improves workers productivity.

There are a lot of SaaS offerings even from some of the leading cloud providers, some of these offerings include:
- Microsoft office 365
- Google workspace
- Canva
- Dropbox
- Slack
- Shopify
- Salesforce
